    #### Description:

    Final Project for CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python

    This project is about developing an app for someone who wants to send a secret message to anyone by adding it to an image. Just be sure you're not using this app for cheating! :)

    How to use:

    1. Request login access by clicking the "contact admin" located beneath the login button.

    2. If you already have the login credentials, you can now use them to log in to the app.

    3. Once you've successfully logged in, you can now start by opening an image you want to use. This will only work on PNG and JPG file extensions.

    4. After opening an image, you can now add your secret message in the text box. To clear the text box, just press the "Clear Textbox" button.

    5. If you're already sure of your secret message, press "Hide Message" to add and hide it on the image of your choice.

    6. The image will duplicate and will save as a new image with "(!)" in its filename.

    7. You can rename the image and send it to someone you would like to show your secret message to.

    8. The receiver then opens the app on his/her computer and logs in. For security reasons, only admin will provide login credentials.

    9. Once the receiver successfully logs in, he/she will need to press the "Open Image" button to open the image with the secret message in it.

    10. Then just press the "Show Message" button and it will reveal the secret message!

    That's all. Enjoy using the app!
